# emacs-nautilus

This repo provides a emacs extension for Nautilus. Based on https://github.com/harry-cpp/code-nautilus. 
For now only works when used on file not on directory.

## Install Extension

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rybski/emacs-nautilus/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Uninstall Extension

```
rm -f ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions/emacs-nautilus.py
```

### TODO:
- Run emacs as a client
- Open dir path in emacs folder browser buffer thingy
